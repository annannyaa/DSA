An island is a small piece of land surrounded by water . A group of islands is said to be connected if we can reach from any given island to any other island in the same group . Given V islands (numbered from 1 to V) and E connections or edges between islands. Can you count the number of connected groups of islands.
Sample Input 1:
5 8
0 1
0 4
1 2
2 0
2 4
3 0
3 2
4 3
Sample Output 1:
1
